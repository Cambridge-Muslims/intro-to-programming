# Intro to Programming

A quick aside on things you can build with a programming language(s):
- Server-side programs
	- E.g. the “brains” behind Uber, like pairing drivers with passengers, routing, etc.
	- Often referred to as “backend” programming
- Websites
	- Often referred to as “frontend” programming
	- Is concerned with what faces the end user, e.g. buttons, forms, tabs, etc.
	- Note: this is usually coupled with a backend
- Automation tools
	- E.g. a bot which monitors a website and notifies you of a sudden price drop
- Financial analysis tools
- Just about anything else

# Part 1: Learning a language

I assume you have zero programming experience. The programming language you learn first, contrary to the garbage you may see online, doesn’t matter all that much. They’re all very similar and once you learn one, you can learn another very very easily. I suggest Python as it has a gentle learning curve, high employability prospects, and is typically the language of choice for coding interviews and quick prototyping.

There are two YouTube playlists which cover learning the core of the language:

You will find yourself having to break down compound human tasks into their most basic, atomic parts. E.g. "brush your teeth" may be broken down into: walk to the bathroom -> locate your toothbrush -> pick it up -> apply toothpaste -> …

It’s very important at each stage to experiment with what you’ve learnt. Like maths, you will learn by toying and experimenting with the language instead of passively watching videos.

# Part 2: Applying the language

## 2a: Building things

At this point, you should try to ween yourself off of tutorials and start building stuff. Begin with a very simple idea of a program you want to build and attempt to build it. You’re guaranteed to get stuck almost immediately, and that’s the point of this part: get familiar with googling (and now ChatGPT-ing) almost everything.

Example:

I want to build a Python program which takes in a temperature in Fahrenheit from the user and outputs the corresponding temperature in degrees Celsius.

Things which I may google:
	•	How do I take in input from the user?
	•	How do I convert a number in Fahrenheit to Celsius?
	•	How do I output a number to the user?
